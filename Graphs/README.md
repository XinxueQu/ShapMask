# Graphs
All graphs in the manuscript can be found and recreated using the Rmarkdown files in this folder. This folder contains three R files and their corresponding knitted file in HTML, namely:
* [`Credit Card - Figure_4_6.RMD`](Graphs/Credit%20Card%20-%20Figure_4_6.Rmd): This creates figures 4 to 6 in the manuscript.
* [`Illustrative_Case_Credit_Fig7.RMD`](Graphs/Illustrative_Case_Credit_Fig7.Rmd): This creates figures 7 (a) and (b) in the manuscript.
* [`Illustrative_Case_Salary_Fig8.RMD`](Graphs/Illustrative_Case_Salary_Fig8.Rmd): This creates figures 8 (a) and (b) in the manuscript.
